            <ExpandableSection title="How Much Does a New Roof Cost in 2025?" defaultOpen={true}>
              <p>
                <strong>A new roof costs $8,000 to $25,000 for most homes.</strong> The average price is $12,000 to $15,000. This is for a regular house with shingle roofing.
              </p>
              <p>
                Knowing what affects the price helps you plan. Here is what changes your cost:
              </p>
              <h4>Roof Size</h4>
              <p>
                Roofers measure roofs in "squares." One square equals 100 square feet. Most homes have 15 to 30 squares. Bigger roofs cost more because they need more materials and work.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our free tool measures your roof from satellite photos. No one needs to climb on your roof.
              </p>
              <h4>Roof Materials</h4>
              <p>
                What your roof is made of changes the price a lot. Here is what each type costs:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Basic Shingles:</strong> $3-$5 per sq ft (cheapest, lasts 15-20 years)</li>
                <li><strong>Nice Shingles:</strong> $4-$7 per sq ft (most popular, lasts 25-30 years)</li>
                <li><strong>Metal Roofing:</strong> $8-$16 per sq ft (very strong, lasts 40-70 years)</li>
                <li><strong>Tile Roofing:</strong> $10-$20 per sq ft (fancy, lasts 50-100 years)</li>
                <li><strong>Slate Roofing:</strong> $15-$30 per sq ft (top quality, lasts 75-150+ years)</li>
              </ul>
              <h4>Roof Shape</h4>
              <p>
                Steep roofs cost more. They need special safety gear and take longer to do. Simple flat roofs cost less than roofs with many angles and peaks.
              </p>
              <h4>Where You Live</h4>
              <p>
                Prices change by area. Big cities usually cost more than small towns. Places with lots of storms may have higher prices. Our tool uses your location to give you the right price.
              </p>
              <h4>Taking Off the Old Roof</h4>
              <p>
                Most jobs need to remove the old roof first. This adds $1 to $3 per square foot. Some roofers will put new shingles over old ones to save money. But this does not always follow the rules.

            <ExpandableSection title="What Is a Roof Estimate?">
              <p>
                <strong>A roof estimate tells you how much it will cost</strong> to fix or replace your roof. Getting a good estimate is the first step. Without one, you might pay too much or get surprised by costs.
              </p>
              <h4>Ways to Get a Roof Estimate</h4>
              <p>
                <strong>Online Estimates (Like Ours):</strong> Type your address. We use satellite photos and smart tools to measure your roof. You get a price in about 60 seconds. This is great for planning your budget.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>In-Person Estimates:</strong> A roofer comes to your home. They look at your roof and give you a price. This takes longer but can be more exact. The roofer can see things that satellites cannot.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Insurance Estimates:</strong> If a storm damaged your roof, your insurance company sends someone to look. They decide how much the insurance will pay.
              </p>
              <h4>Why Get More Than One Estimate?</h4>
              <p>
                Experts say to get at least three estimates. This helps you:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Know what is a fair price in your area</li>
                <li>Compare materials and promises from different roofers</li>
                <li>Spot roofers who charge too much</li>
                <li>Find the best deal for your money</li>
                <li>Watch out for prices that are way too low (they might cut corners)</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Our free estimate gives you a starting point. Use it when you talk to roofers to make sure their prices are fair.

            <ExpandableSection title="Signs You Need a New Roof">
              <p>
                Knowing when you need a new roof saves money. Fix problems before they damage the inside of your home. Here is what to watch for:
              </p>
              <h4>How Old Is Your Roof?</h4>
              <p>
                Most shingle roofs last 20-30 years. If yours is getting close to that age, get an estimate. Even if it looks okay, it might be time. A new roof before leaks start protects your home better.
              </p>
              <h4>What to Look For Outside</h4>
              <p>
                Walk around your home and check for:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Curling shingles:</strong> Edges curling up means they are old</li>
                <li><strong>Missing shingles:</strong> Gaps let water get in</li>
                <li><strong>Cracked shingles:</strong> Brittle shingles cannot protect your home</li>
                <li><strong>Gritty bits in gutters:</strong> Shingles losing their coating are wearing out</li>
                <li><strong>Moss or green stuff:</strong> Heavy growth can trap water</li>
              </ul>
              <h4>What to Look For Inside</h4>
              <p>
                Sometimes you see problems inside first:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Brown spots on ceilings:</strong> Water is getting in</li>
                <li><strong>Light in your attic:</strong> If you see daylight through the roof, that is bad</li>
                <li><strong>Sagging areas:</strong> Dips in your roof are a warning sign</li>
                <li><strong>High energy bills:</strong> A bad roof lets heat escape</li>
                <li><strong>Mold smell:</strong> Especially in the attic, this means water problems</li>
              </ul>
              <h4>After Storms</h4>
              <p>
                Always check your roof after big storms. Hail can hurt shingles. Wind can pull them off. Branches can cause damage you can see. Tell your insurance company fast. Most have a time limit for claims.

            <ExpandableSection title="How to Get a Free Roof Estimate Online">
              <p>
                Getting a free estimate online is easy. You can get a price without anyone coming to your house. Here is how our tool works:
              </p>
              <h4>Step 1: Type Your Address</h4>
              <p>
                Put your home address in our search box. We use Google to find your property. You do not need an account. You do not need a credit card.
              </p>
              <h4>Step 2: We Measure Your Roof</h4>
              <p>
                Our smart tools look at satellite photos of your home. We figure out:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>How big your roof is</li>
                <li>How steep it is</li>
                <li>How complex the shape is</li>
                <li>How many sections it has</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Insurance companies use the same kind of satellite tools. Our measurements are 90-95% accurate for most homes.
              </p>
              <h4>Step 3: Get Your Price</h4>
              <p>
                In about 60 seconds, you see:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Low, middle, and high prices</li>
                <li>Your roof size in square feet</li>
                <li>What different materials cost</li>
                <li>Prices for your area</li>
              </ul>
              <h4>Step 4: Talk to a Roofer (If You Want)</h4>
              <p>
                After you get your estimate, you can talk to a roofer near you. They can answer questions and come look at your roof in person. You do not have to say yes to anything.

            <ExpandableSection title="Should You Repair or Replace Your Roof?">
              <p>
                Not every roof problem needs a whole new roof. Sometimes a repair is enough. Here is how to decide:
              </p>
              <h4>When to Repair</h4>
              <p>
                A repair is a good choice when:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Small damage area:</strong> Just a few shingles are missing or hurt</li>
                <li><strong>Roof is under 15 years old:</strong> It still has many good years left</li>
                <li><strong>Less than 30% needs work:</strong> Most of the roof is fine</li>
                <li><strong>No big problems:</strong> The wood under the shingles is solid</li>
                <li><strong>Repair costs less than half a new roof:</strong> If it costs more, a new roof makes sense</li>
              </ul>
              <h4>When to Replace</h4>
              <p>
                A new roof is better when:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Roof is over 20 years old:</strong> It is near the end of its life</li>
                <li><strong>Damage is everywhere:</strong> Many spots are worn or hurt</li>
                <li><strong>Leaks keep coming back:</strong> Patches are not fixing the problem</li>
                <li><strong>Wood is rotting:</strong> The structure has problems</li>
                <li><strong>You are selling your home:</strong> A new roof helps sell faster</li>
                <li><strong>Insurance says so:</strong> Some companies need new roofs after a certain age</li>
              </ul>
              <h4>Think About the Long Run</h4>
              <p>
                Here is an example. Your 18-year-old roof needs $4,000 in repairs. A new roof costs $12,000. The repair seems cheaper. But your roof only has 5-7 years left anyway.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you repair now, you still need a new roof soon. The $12,000 roof gives you 25-30 years of protection. Often, the new roof is the better deal over time.

            <ExpandableSection title="How to Pick a Good Roofer">
              <p>
                Picking the right roofer matters a lot. Even great shingles fail if put on wrong. Here is how to find someone good:
              </p>
              <h4>Check License and Insurance</h4>
              <p>
                Every good roofer should have:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>State license:</strong> This proves they meet basic standards</li>
                <li><strong>Liability insurance:</strong> Pays if they damage your property</li>
                <li><strong>Workers compensation:</strong> Covers hurt workers. Without it, you could get in trouble</li>
                <li><strong>Bond (if your state needs it):</strong> Protects you if they do not finish</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Ask for insurance papers. Call the insurance company to make sure they are real.
              </p>
              <h4>Read Reviews</h4>
              <p>
                Look up the roofer online:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Read Google, Yelp, and BBB reviews</li>
                <li>Ask for names of past customers you can call</li>
                <li>Check for complaints at your state's license board</li>
                <li>Look for special training from companies like GAF, Owens Corning, or CertainTeed</li>
              </ul>
              <h4>Get Everything in Writing</h4>
              <p>
                A good estimate should list:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Exactly what work they will do</li>
                <li>What materials they will use (brand, type, color)</li>
                <li>When they will finish</li>
                <li>The total price with no hidden fees</li>
                <li>When to pay (never pay all upfront)</li>
                <li>What promises they make about the work</li>
                <li>Who gets the permits</li>
              </ul>
              <h4>Warning Signs</h4>
              <p>
                Stay away from roofers who:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Want all the money upfront</li>
                <li>Only take cash</li>
                <li>Push you to decide right now</li>
                <li>Have no real office address</li>
                <li>Quote prices way lower than everyone else</li>
                <li>Will not show license or insurance papers</li>
                <li>Want to use leftover materials from other jobs</li>
              </ul>

            <ExpandableSection title="Roof Warranties Explained">
              <p>
                Warranties protect your money. But they can be confusing. Here is what you need to know:
              </p>
              <h4>Material Warranty</h4>
              <p>
                This covers problems with the shingles themselves. Most companies offer:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Basic warranty:</strong> 20-30 years. Covers factory defects only.</li>
                <li><strong>Better warranty:</strong> 40-50 years. Covers defects plus wind and algae.</li>
                <li><strong>Best warranty:</strong> Lifetime. Higher wind protection. Can transfer to new owners.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Note: "Lifetime" means the life of the shingles, not your life. Coverage often goes down over time.
              </p>
              <h4>Work Warranty</h4>
              <p>
                This covers mistakes the roofer makes. A roof can fail even with good shingles if put on wrong. Look for:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>1-2 years:</strong> Too short. Try to find better.</li>
                <li><strong>5-10 years:</strong> Good. Look for at least this much.</li>
                <li><strong>15-25 years:</strong> Great. Top roofers offer this.</li>
              </ul>
              <h4>Special Warranties</h4>
              <p>
                When certified roofers use certain brands, you can get extra protection:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Longer coverage backed by the company</li>
                <li>Covers the whole roof system, not just shingles</li>
                <li>Full coverage that does not go down over time</li>
                <li>Can transfer to new owners if you sell</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Examples: GAF Golden Pledge, Owens Corning Platinum Protection, CertainTeed SureStart PLUS.
              </p>
              <h4>What Breaks a Warranty</h4>
              <p>
                These things can void your warranty:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Roof put on wrong</li>
                <li>Not enough air flow in your attic</li>

            <ExpandableSection title="Ways to Pay for a New Roof">
              <p>
                A new roof costs a lot. But there are many ways to pay. Here are your options:
              </p>
              <h4>Insurance Claims</h4>
              <p>
                If a storm damaged your roof, insurance may pay. You pay your deductible ($500-$2,500 for most people). Insurance pays the rest. Take photos of damage. File your claim fast.
              </p>
              <h4>Home Equity Loans</h4>
              <p>
                These loans use your home as backup. They often have lower rates (usually 5-10%). The interest might be tax deductible. Ask a tax advisor. You can pay back over many years.
              </p>
              <h4>Personal Loans</h4>
              <p>
                These loans do not need home equity. You get approved faster. Rates are usually 6-20% based on your credit score. Online lenders often have good rates.
              </p>
              <h4>Roofer Payment Plans</h4>
              <p>
                Many roofers work with loan companies. Some have 0% interest for 12-18 months. Read all the fine print. Know what happens if you do not pay it off in time.
              </p>
              <h4>Credit Cards</h4>
              <p>
                Cards work for smaller jobs or deposits. Some cards have 0% interest for a while. This is like free borrowing if you pay before the deal ends. But regular card rates are high. Be careful with big amounts.
              </p>
              <h4>FHA Title 1 Loans</h4>
              <p>
                The government backs these loans for home fixes. You do not need much home equity. Rates are fair. This is good if you do not have a lot of equity built up.
              </p>

            <ExpandableSection title="Best Time to Replace Your Roof">
              <p>
                When you replace your roof can change the cost and quality. Here is what to know:
              </p>
              <h4>Spring (March-May)</h4>
              <p>
                Good temperatures for roofing. Roofers are getting ready for busy season. You beat the summer rush. But spring storms can cause delays.
              </p>
              <h4>Summer (June-August)</h4>
              <p>
                Busiest time for roofers. Prices may be higher. Very hot days make shingles too soft. Workers struggle in heat. Try to book early in summer.
              </p>
              <h4>Fall (September-November)</h4>
              <p>
                Many people think fall is the best time. Nice temperatures. Less humidity. You get a new roof before winter. Book early because everyone wants fall.
              </p>
              <h4>Winter (December-February)</h4>
              <p>
                You might get lower prices. But cold weather causes problems. Shingles do not seal well in cold. Weather delays are more common. Best only for mild climates or emergencies.
              </p>
              <h4>Temperature Matters</h4>
              <p>
                Shingles work best between 45°F and 85°F. Below 40°F, shingles can crack. They will not seal until it warms up. Very hot days make shingles too soft. Workers also face safety risks in heat.
              </p>
              <h4>Plan Ahead</h4>
              <p>
                Do not wait until your roof is leaking. The best time to get an estimate is before you have problems. Get your free estimate now. Plan and budget before trouble starts.

            <ExpandableSection title="Comparing Roof Materials">
              <p>
                Picking the right material means thinking about cost, how long it lasts, how it looks, and your weather. Here is a guide:
              </p>
              <h4>Asphalt Shingles</h4>
              <p>
                <strong>Cost:</strong> $3-$7 per sq ft<br />
                <strong>Lasts:</strong> 15-30 years<br />

              <p>
                Most popular choice in America. Good value for the price. Comes in many colors. Works in most places. Pick nicer shingles over basic ones. They last longer and look better.
              </p>
              <h4>Metal Roofing</h4>
              <p>
                <strong>Cost:</strong> $8-$16 per sq ft<br />
                <strong>Lasts:</strong> 40-70 years<br />
                <strong>Best for:</strong> People staying long-term, tough weather, saving energy

              <p>
                Getting more popular. Lasts a very long time. Reflects sun heat so you save on cooling. Costs more upfront but can save money over many years.
              </p>
              <h4>Tile Roofing</h4>
              <p>
                <strong>Cost:</strong> $10-$20 per sq ft<br />
                <strong>Lasts:</strong> 50-100 years<br />
                <strong>Best for:</strong> Hot, dry places, Spanish-style homes
              </p>
              <p>
                Clay and concrete tiles last forever. They are heavy. Your roof needs to be strong enough. Great at stopping fire. Does well in hot sun. Popular in Southwest, Florida, and California.
              </p>
              <h4>Slate Roofing</h4>
              <p>
                <strong>Cost:</strong> $15-$30 per sq ft<br />
                <strong>Lasts:</strong> 75-150+ years<br />
                <strong>Best for:</strong> Old homes, fancy houses, families passing homes down
              </p>
              <p>
                Real stone. Can last over 100 years. Very heavy. Needs a strong roof. Hard to fix. Needs special workers. Costs the most upfront. But the cost per year can be lower than other roofs over time.
              </p>
              <h4>Wood Shakes</h4>
              <p>
                <strong>Cost:</strong> $8-$14 per sq ft<br />
                <strong>Lasts:</strong> 20-40 years<br />
                <strong>Best for:</strong> Rustic look, mild weather
              </p>
              <p>
                Cedar shakes look beautiful. They insulate well. But they need more care. They are not fireproof unless treated. Do not work well in wet places. Some towns do not allow them.

            <ExpandableSection title="What Is in a Roof Estimate?">
              <p>
                A good estimate tells you everything. Here is what to look for:
              </p>
              <h4>Material Costs</h4>
              <p>
                The estimate should list:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Shingles:</strong> Brand, type, color, how many</li>
                <li><strong>Under layer:</strong> The protective sheet under shingles</li>
                <li><strong>Water shield:</strong> Extra protection in valleys and edges</li>
                <li><strong>Metal pieces:</strong> Around chimney, vents, and edges</li>
                <li><strong>Special shingles:</strong> For edges and peaks</li>
                <li><strong>Vents:</strong> To let air flow through your attic</li>
                <li><strong>Nails:</strong> What kind and how many</li>
              </ul>
              <h4>Labor Costs</h4>
              <p>
                Workers usually cost 40-60% of your total. What changes labor costs:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>How steep your roof is</li>
                <li>How many stories your house has</li>
                <li>How easy it is to reach</li>
                <li>What workers charge in your area</li>
                <li>If they need to tear off old roofing</li>
              </ul>
              <h4>Removal and Trash</h4>
              <p>
                Taking off old shingles adds $1-$3 per square foot. This includes:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Removing old shingles and under layer</li>
                <li>Checking and fixing wood underneath</li>
                <li>Renting a big trash bin</li>
                <li>Paying to dump the old stuff</li>
              </ul>
              <h4>Permits</h4>
              <p>
                Most places need a permit for roof work. Permits cost $100-$500. Your roofer should get the permit as part of the job.
              </p>
              <h4>Warranties</h4>
              <p>
                The estimate should say what promises you get. Better warranties might cost a bit more but protect you.

            <ExpandableSection title="What Are the Different Roof Types?">
              <p>
                <strong>Your roof type affects cost, durability, and how your home looks.</strong> Here are the most common roof styles in the United States:
              </p>
              <h4>Hip Roof</h4>
              <p>
                A hip roof has slopes on all four sides. All sides come together at the top in a ridge. This is one of the most popular roof types in America. Hip roofs are very strong against wind and storms because the angled sides push wind over the roof instead of catching it.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Cost:</strong> Hip roofs cost 10-15% more than gable roofs because they have more surface area and more complex framing. They work great in areas with hurricanes, high winds, or heavy snow.
              </p>
              <h4>Gable Roof</h4>
              <p>
                A gable roof has two sloping sides that meet at a ridge at the top. The ends form a triangle shape called a gable. This is the most common roof type in the US. Gable roofs are simple to build and give good attic space for ventilation and storage.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Cost:</strong> Gable roofs are the most affordable to build. The simple shape uses less material and takes less labor. But the flat gable ends can catch wind, so they need extra bracing in storm-prone areas.
              </p>
              <h4>What Is the Rake on a Roof?</h4>
              <p>
                The rake is the sloped edge of a gable roof. It runs from the eave (bottom edge) to the ridge (top). The rake needs proper flashing and drip edge to keep water from getting under the shingles. A rake overhang of 6-12 inches helps protect your walls from rain.
              </p>
              <h4>What Is a Roof Cricket?</h4>
              <p>
                A roof cricket is a small peaked structure built behind a chimney or other roof feature. Its job is to divert water and debris away from the back of the chimney. Without a cricket, water pools behind the chimney and causes leaks. Building codes require a cricket on chimneys wider than 30 inches.
              </p>
              <h4>Flat Roof</h4>
              <p>
                Flat roofs are not truly flat. They have a slight slope (usually 1/4 inch per foot) to drain water. Common on commercial buildings, they are also used on modern homes and additions. Flat roofs cost $4-$10 per square foot and use materials like TPO, EPDM rubber, or modified bitumen.
              </p>
              <h4>Mansard Roof</h4>
              <p>
                A mansard roof has four sides, each with two slopes. The lower slope is very steep and the upper slope is nearly flat. This design creates usable living space in the attic. Mansard roofs are common on French-style homes and older buildings. They cost more due to their complex shape.
              </p>
              <h4>Which Roof Type Is Best?</h4>
              <p>
                The best roof type depends on your climate, budget, and home style. Hip roofs are best for storm areas. Gable roofs are the most affordable. Our free estimate works with any roof type. Enter your address and we measure your exact roof shape from satellite photos.

            <ExpandableSection title="How to Figure Out Your Roof Pitch">
              <p>
                <strong>Roof pitch is how steep your roof is.</strong> It is written as a ratio like 6/12, which means the roof rises 6 inches for every 12 inches of horizontal distance. Knowing your pitch matters because steeper roofs cost more to work on.
              </p>
              <h4>Common Roof Pitches</h4>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Low pitch (2/12 to 4/12):</strong> Almost flat. Easier and safer to work on. Common on modern homes, additions, and porches. Needs special roofing materials to prevent leaks.</li>
                <li><strong>Standard pitch (5/12 to 7/12):</strong> The most common range. Works with most roofing materials. Good balance of drainage and walkability.</li>
                <li><strong>Steep pitch (8/12 to 12/12):</strong> Very steep. Sheds water and snow quickly. Looks dramatic. Costs more because workers need special safety gear and harnesses.</li>
                <li><strong>Very steep (over 12/12):</strong> Found on church steeples, Victorian homes, and A-frame cabins. Expensive to roof because of extreme safety requirements.</li>
              </ul>
              <h4>How to Calculate Roof Pitch</h4>
              <p>
                You can measure your roof pitch from inside your attic:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Place a level against a rafter in your attic</li>
                <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Mark 12 inches on the level from where it touches the rafter</li>
                <li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Measure straight up from that 12-inch mark to the rafter</li>
                <li><strong>Step 4:</strong> That measurement is your rise. A 6-inch rise means you have a 6/12 pitch</li>
              </ul>
              <h4>Why Roof Pitch Affects Your Cost</h4>
              <p>
                Steeper roofs have more surface area. A 12/12 pitch roof has about 40% more surface area than a flat roof over the same floor plan. More area means more materials. Steep roofs also need safety equipment and take longer to install. Our satellite estimate tool already accounts for your roof pitch when calculating your price.
              </p>
              <h4>Roof Slope vs Roof Pitch</h4>
              <p>
                People use "roof slope" and "roof pitch" to mean the same thing. Technically, slope is the ratio of rise to run (like 6:12), while pitch is the ratio of rise to the full span. In everyday use, they mean the same thing. A 6/12 slope is a moderate roof that most roofers handle easily.

            <ExpandableSection title="What Is a Roofing Square?">
              <p>
                <strong>A roofing square is 100 square feet of roof area.</strong> Roofers use this unit to price jobs. When a roofer says your roof is "25 squares," that means 2,500 square feet of roof surface.
              </p>
              <h4>How to Calculate Roofing Squares</h4>
              <p>
                To figure out how many squares your roof has:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Measure the length and width of each roof section</li>
                <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Multiply length by width to get square feet for each section</li>
                <li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Add all sections together for total square feet</li>
                <li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Divide by 100 to get the number of roofing squares</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                <strong>Example:</strong> A roof with two sections of 1,200 sq ft each = 2,400 sq ft total = 24 roofing squares.
              </p>
              <h4>How Many Shingles in a Square?</h4>
              <p>
                One roofing square needs 3 bundles of standard three-tab shingles. Architectural (dimensional) shingles may need 4-5 bundles per square because they are thicker. Each bundle covers about 33 square feet.
              </p>
              <h4>Cost Per Roofing Square</h4>
              <p>

            <ExpandableSection title="Metal Roof Installation: What to Know">
              <p>
                <strong>Metal roofing is growing fast in popularity.</strong> It now accounts for about 17% of the residential roofing market. Metal roofs last 40-70 years and can save you money on energy bills. Here is what you need to know about installing one.
              </p>
              <h4>Types of Metal Roofing</h4>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Standing seam:</strong> The premium choice. Panels lock together with raised seams. Very waterproof. Costs $10-$16 per sq ft.</li>
                <li><strong>Corrugated metal:</strong> Wavy panels. More affordable at $5-$10 per sq ft. Common on barns and modern farmhouse-style homes.</li>
                <li><strong>Metal shingles:</strong> Look like regular shingles but made from metal. $8-$14 per sq ft. Good if you want the metal benefits with a traditional look.</li>
                <li><strong>Steel roofing:</strong> The most common metal. Coated with zinc (galvanized) or aluminum-zinc (Galvalume) to resist rust. Strong and affordable.</li>
                <li><strong>Aluminum roofing:</strong> Lighter than steel. Does not rust. Great for coastal areas with salt air. Costs a bit more than steel.</li>
              </ul>
              <h4>Can You Install Metal Over Shingles?</h4>
              <p>
                Yes, in many cases you can install metal roofing over existing asphalt shingles. This saves the cost of tear-off ($1-$3 per sq ft). But check your local building codes first. Some areas require removing old shingles. Also, the old roof must be in decent shape with no rot underneath.
              </p>
              <h4>How Long Does Metal Roof Installation Take?</h4>
              <p>
                A metal roof takes 2-5 days to install on an average home. Standing seam takes longer because each panel must be precisely measured and fastened. Corrugated panels go up faster. Weather delays are possible since metal is slippery when wet.
              </p>
              <h4>Metal Roof Pros and Cons</h4>
              <p>
                <strong>Pros:</strong> Lasts 40-70 years, reflects heat (saves on cooling), withstands high winds, fire resistant, lightweight, recyclable, increases home value.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Cons:</strong> Higher upfront cost, can be noisy in rain (insulation helps), dents from large hail, needs special tools to cut, expansion and contraction from heat.

            <ExpandableSection title="Basic Roof Repairs You Should Know About">
              <p>
                <strong>Not every roof problem needs a full replacement.</strong> Some repairs are simple and affordable. Here are the most common roof repairs and when you should handle them.
              </p>
              <h4>Patching a Roof</h4>
              <p>
                Roof patching fixes small damaged areas. A roofer removes the damaged shingles, checks the wood underneath, and installs new shingles. A small patch job costs $150-$500. This works when damage is limited to one small area and the rest of the roof is in good shape.
              </p>
              <h4>How to Tarp a Roof in an Emergency</h4>
              <p>
                If your roof gets damaged in a storm, a tarp can prevent further water damage until a roofer arrives:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Use a heavy-duty tarp that extends at least 4 feet past the damaged area</li>
                <li>Secure it with 2x4 boards screwed into the roof deck (not just nailed to shingles)</li>
                <li>Make sure water runs off the tarp and does not pool on it</li>
                <li>This is a temporary fix. Get a roofer out as soon as possible</li>
              </ul>
              <h4>Fixing Roof Leaks</h4>
              <p>
                The most common leak spots are around flashings (metal pieces around chimneys, vents, and valleys). Often the fix is replacing old caulk or damaged flashing. This costs $200-$600. Leaks around vent pipes are usually a $100-$300 fix with a new rubber boot.
              </p>
              <h4>When to Repair vs Replace</h4>
              <p>
                Repair makes sense when damage is less than 30% of your roof, the roof is under 15 years old, and the underlying wood is solid. Replace when damage is widespread, the roof is over 20 years old, or repairs would cost more than half a new roof.
